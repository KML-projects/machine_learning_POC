# Agile Estimation

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks about applying machine learning techniques. You can read them in the following order:
1. [Using statistics in agile estimation](agile_estimation_2.ipynb) - a general discussion about how to estimate projects in a statistically correct way
1. [Agile Estimation: missed opportunity and missed deadlines](agile_estimation_3.ipynb) - discusses what really matters in the project estimation, the tradeoffs and the objectives in the project, and how they direct our actions
1. [Treating the range estimates](range_estimates.ipynb) - discusses how we should deal when the estimates are given to us as a range. 
1. [Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for project estimation](Sampling.ipynb) - Sometimes inference cannot be done easily. This notebook discusses using MCMC for getting samples from the posterior distribution
1. [Estimating completion date using burndown chart](Burndown_chart.ipynb) - Burndown charts are important tools for Agile estimation. Here we use time series forecasting techniques to construct and interpret the burn-down chart.
