# Welcome to my personal machine learning projects
The repository for various machine learning projects, all of them in the POC phase. For some of them I may write an open source library, but it will be in a different repo

The projects completed so far are:
* Aggregate Functions
* Agile Estimation
* Debiasing Impuration
* Employee Attrition
* Rasch Model
* Regularization
* Spectral Analysis
* Unit Tests
